COP 2805C (Java II) Project Team: Coffee123: Adriel Lopez, Manuel Tamayo
Search Engine Utilities for Text Files
The Coffee123 group explored using a MySQL database to index and search text files.
The Lucene java based search engine library was used instead as it is high performance
and includes its own NonSQL database.
This part of the project includes indexing, searching and deleting index documents.
The Luke utility, which is bundled with Lucene 8.1.1, can be used to modify the index database as needed.
Adriel's branch (Beta1) is not accessible, but part of his work is work is present in the code.
